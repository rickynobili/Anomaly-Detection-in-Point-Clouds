%  Builds kernels cell arrays kernels{direction,size}
%                  and        kernels_higher_order{direction,size,1:2}
%               kernels_higher_order{direction,size,1}  is the 3D matrix
%                   of all kernels for that particular direction/size
%               kernels_higher_order{direction,size,2}  is the 2D matrix
%                   containing the orders indices for the kernels
%                   contained in kernels_higher_order{direction,size,1}
%
%   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
% 
%   kernels_higher_order{direction,size,1}(:,:,1) is the funcion estimate kernel
%   kernels_higher_order{direction,size,1}(:,:,2) is a first derivative estimate kernel
%
%   kernels_higher_order{direction,size,1}(:,:,n) is a higher order derivative estimate kernel
%   whose orders with respect to x and y are specified in
%   kernels_higher_order{direction,size,2}(n,:)=
%                           =[xorder yorder xorder+yorder]
